# scop

A small program that parses and render simple obj files from scratch with OpenGL.
No glm or matrix libraries.

## How to use

`make && ./scop resources/42.obj`

You can move the object with `WASD`, `JK` for Down/Up, `+` and `-` to make it grow bigger or smaller.
You can trigger the fade-in of a kitten texture by pressing `T`, I don't recommend it though.
